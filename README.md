# SEO-Optimization-Work

## Description
This project was completed as part of the OSU Coding Bootcamp. The Horiseon website seeks to inform their clients of their SEO services. 
The page was modified to be more accessible for those navigating it with assistive technology. 
Compliance with these guidelines has the added benefit of boosting the SEO of the page, 
something a company looking to book clients for their SEO services should value greatly for many reasons.

Working on this project familiarized me with the process of commiting changes to Github and launching a webpage. 
I also became much more confident using the Inspect tool to observe a page, and making appropriate changes to the HTML and CSS code using VSCode.
## Installation
Go to https://tjtahmas.github.io/SEO-Optimization-Work/ to visit the website. 
## Usage
Feel free to use the Inspect tool in Chrome to observe the code and CSS styling.
